## Contributing

There's always something that can be improved, and if you find something, feel
free to open a pull request! When contributing, all developers should follow the
following guidelines to keep things simple:

* Use `.editorconfig` with your editor (most have plugins), it defines the basic
  styling rules (there aren't many)
* Separate each feature or improvement into a separate branch on a forked
  repository. Submit a pull request from each feature branch to this repository.
* Builds are automated by Travis, don't worry about it!
