## What is [Go](https://golang.org/)?

Simply put, Go is a simple-to-use compiled language. It comes packaged with
benefits such as static typing, garbage collection, great tooling, excellent
concurrency primitives and a robust standard library. It compiles extremely
fast, and cross-compiles to all major platforms using one command.

All of this gives you comparable speed to C/C++, with the development
proficiency of popular interpreted languages.

Check out some quick examples of common tasks from [Go by Example](https://gobyexample.com/)
and the [Golang Book](https://www.golang-book.com/)

## What is Utah Golang?

Utah Golang is a community of people interested in developing software using the
Go programming language. We're here to promote growth of a lively and dynamic
community of Go enthusiasts in Utah. We aim to disseminate knowledge about the
language and promote its use.

Utah Golang promotes Free and Open Source Software, and publish our software and
creative assets as open source. We encourage our community to do the same.

## Activities

We have regular (generally monthly) meetups consisting of presentations by both
members of our community, and whenever possible, industry leaders.

Attendance is free and open to everyone. Our sponsors often allow us to have
snacks and drinks to foster a climate where discussions are welcomed and
appreciated.

We will often present concepts in laymen terms and as such our meetings will
cater to people of all skill set levels: newcomers as well as experts. Whenever
possible, we will provide a list of any prerequisite knowledge so you can
prepare beforehand if needed.
